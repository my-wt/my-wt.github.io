									Writing</h1>
									<p>Writing is a cathartic outlet. I have always written
									snatches of poems, songs, and prose. As I get older,
									I have seen the history of who I was, from a young child to 
									a young adult, through the pieces I have written. Here I share
									some of what I wrote while completing a degree in English.</p>

                            <h4>Movement</h4>
                            We are a circle of fire.
                            Baring our chests to the open forest,
                            shadowing the grass with our
                            distorted bodies.

                            The longer I lie here,
                            the more I becomes we.
                            We laugh out loud,
                            and more quietly we sing,
                            to ourselves,
                            the music of no voices.

                            We are outlines now.
                            Movement without mass.
                            I bend, you arch,
                            we traipse
                            through and through
                            trees bending themselves
                            out of our way.

                            The longer I dance,
                            the more you becomes I,
                            the more I becomes we.

                            We lie.

                            She was not born without,
                            they were taken.

                            She did not willingingly go,
                            she was given.

                            She did not forcibly enter,
                            she was shown.

                            She did not disrupt,
                            she was loved.

                            Walking on in a circle and standing still in her circle,
                                of white, in white.
                                Who wanted control,
                                and who feared it?

                            Cleansing and protecting, then becoming a barrier,
                                with water, at the water’s edge.
                                She had roamed until she forgot
                                if she was girl or spirit.
                                An angel, of white, in white,
                                erased the barrier.

                            He was the counter, he was the watchman
                                of pears, of spirits, of her.
                                Without hands, she ate
                                the pear’s body bursting 
                                sweet and golden.
                                But nothing could replace her hands.
